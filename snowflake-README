Shared Databases

SHARE -> object such as database, tables, views etc which can be imported by other databases / consumers.

Shares are named Snowflake objects that encapsulate all of the information required to share a database. Each share consists of:

    The privileges that grant access to the database(s) and the schema containing the objects to share.

    The privileges that grant access to the specific objects (tables, secure views, and secure UDFs).

    The consumer accounts with which the database and its objects are shared.

    New objects added to a share become immediately available to all consumers, providing real-time access to shared data.
    
    Access to a share (or any of the objects in a share) can be revoked at any time.
    
    
SNOWFLAKE database => provider of data which shares account usage and sample datasets for all accounts.
When an account is created, SNOWFLAKE database is automatically imported into each account from a Share named as ACCOUNT_USAGE.
Contains views similar to DBA* views in oracle.

Command -> show views;

------------------------------

-- creating a secure view ( can be used similar to a VPD in oracle) and are used specifically to enforce data privacy. These views do not enforce query optimization.
-- This is because the Snowflake query optimizer, when evaluating secure views, bypasses certain optimizations used for regular views. 
-- This may result in some impact on query performance for secure views.
CREATE OR REPLACE SECURE VIEW <name> AS <select>

-- Parameter for simuating a shared account
